Implements a parser, simulator, and client/server evaluation architecture for the relational dynamic influence diagram language (RDDL).  RDDL is intended to compactly support the representation of a wide range of relational MDPs and POMDPs and support the efficient simulation of these domains.  RDDL is used in a number of past and present International Probabilistic Planning Competitions (IPPCs):
